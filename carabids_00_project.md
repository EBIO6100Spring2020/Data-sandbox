Project: NEON-Niwot forest species SDMs

This is a centralized location to organize our thoughts and resources for this project. Thoughts and data are focused on Niwot Ridge site, unless specified otherwise.

##### Scientific questions we could ask
1. How will carabid species distributions shift with global warming in a subalpine forest?

##### Why carabids?
* identifying habitat associations in a dominant insect group would be an important step toward understanding the consequences of global climate change in high mountain areas  (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* Because of their known sensitivity to changes in habitat structure and requisitly altered microhabitat, carabid beetles have been suggested to serve as useful bioindicators of environmental and land use change (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* To date, numerous studies have shown that carabid beetle richness and/or assemblage composition change along altitudinal gradients [5–7] and/or with vegetation type [8–11] (Hiramatsu and Usio 2018)
* Remote sensing can measure carabid habitat at the local and landscape scales. Identifying the predictive relationships between beetle assemblages to remote sensing variables allows conservation managers to measure carabids at a scale appropriate for their biology and scale up to that which management decisions function (Muller et al. 2009).
