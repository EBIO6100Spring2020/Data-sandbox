# Data readme

This file will catalog all of the NWT data in this folder.

### vegetation_sampling

This contains vegetation data from the NWT saddle for various years between the 1990s and the 2010s, with the most frequent sampling in the 2010s. This has some grid-sampling, with plenty of records across time of Deschampsia, Geum, and Kobresia.

### individual_phenology

Contains phenological records of individual plants of Geum (!) (coded as Acomastylis) and two bistorts across several years in the 1980s. Fields: plant development, leaf length, bud, inflorescence, developing fruit, mature fruit, spatial info. Not exactly sure what the differences between this and the seasonal_phenology data is (besides the fields).

### seasonal_phenology

Contains phenological records of individual plants (?) of Geum/Acomastylis and two bistorts in same time frame as individual_phenology. Fields: plant development, leaf length, color change... How is this different from above info?
