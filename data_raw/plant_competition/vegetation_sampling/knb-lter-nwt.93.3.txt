    Permanent 1-m^2 plots were established beside each of the 88 Saddle grid stakes in 1989 by Marilyn Walker, who led the sampling effort until 1997. Each plot was located within 2 m of the stake, but always in the same vegetation type as that associated with the stake. The distance and direction from the grid stake were randomly selected, and thus varied from plot to plot. Point quadrat measurements have been made at irregular intervals from 1989 to the present (1989, 1990, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2008,  and yearly from 2010 onward). The point-quadrat technique used was identical to that described by Auerbach (1992) for sampling in 1989 to 1997: The point-quadrat method was used for estimating plant cover. The aluminum point-quadrat frame was 1 m^2 in size, with double-layer filament spaced 10 cm apart to make a 10 x 10 cm grid, for a total of 100 sample points per plot. Before sampling, the point-quadrat frame was leveled and plots were permanently marked in the following manner. Aluminum tags were nailed into the ground so that a frame could be repositioned in the same location from year to year; i.e., tags with a hole in the middle were used to define the locations for the point frame legs and four tags with a "X" stamped on them (positioned somewhere inside each of the frame corners) were used to define alignment of the frame by positioning the string crossings over these "X"s. Plant genus and species were recorded for top and bottom hits at each point for 1990-1997 data. In 1989, middle hits were also recorded. A plant species hit occurs when a plant part touches a thin metal stick placed at the intersection of 2 filaments in the quadrat. If plant parts of a given species touch the stick at multiple places, only one hit is recorded. In the next sampling year, 2006, and continuing to the present, all hits were recorded at each point, but frame distances were not measured. In addition, exact repositioning of the frame was not possible in some plots due to absence or relocation of tags. Data are formatted as one species hit per row (“string of pearls’).

      The initial iteration of the documentation section was created by Leanne Lestak on 18 March 1994, using the itexptqd.mw documentation section as a template. The initial iteration of the header section was generated, and all 1989 and 1990 data were appended to the data section on this date. Minor editorial revisions were made to the documentation section by RCI on 21 March 1994. The file was put under sccs control on that date as well. [RCI 21 March 1994] Minor editorial revisions to the documentation section were suggested by Marilyn Walker and added on 13 May 1994.[RCI 13 May 1994] Plot locations surveyed by Tim Bardsley and Mike Hartman on 6 July 1994 were added to the comments section on 13 July 1994. [RCI 13 July 1994] Plot locations surveyed by Tim Bardsley and Mike Hartman on 13 July 1994 were added to the comments section on 14 July 1994.[RCI 14 July 1994] Comments and data for the 1995 season were added on 14 December 1995.[MAH 14 December 1995] Ancillary metadata for the 1995 data was added to the comments section on 15 December 1995.[MAH 15 December 1995] Unknowns for stakes 60a, 70a, and 76 for 1995 were corrected, and the data for those stakes were reimported into the data section on 29 December 1995.[MAH 29 December 1995] A comment concerning the use of condition code 5 was added to the comments section on 8 January 1996.[MAH 8 January 1995] On 23 January 1996 Leanne Lestak noted that the plot number for point identification number 6214 for 1995 was incorrectly listed in this file as 26. This was changed to the correct plot number of 58 on 23 January 1996.[MAH 23 January 1996] The reference to Walker et al. (1994) was added to the citations section on 2 May 1996.[MAH 2 May 1996] The data section was deleted and replaced with a new data section on 9 May 1996, following the re-entry of all 1989 and 1990 data. Appropriate changes were also made to the documentation section of this file at that time.[MAH 9 May 1996] On 2 August 1996 it was determined that the 1989 data contained an extra, empty column of data at the end of each record. This column was srtipped off, and the data re-inserted into the data section on 2 August 1996.[MAH 2 August 1996] Data for plot 37 recorded in 1996 were appended to the data section on 11 November 1996.[MAH 11 November 1996] Data for the 1997 field season were appended to the data section and ancillary metadata for 1997 were added to the comments section on 8 December 1997. Corrections for several plants that had been misidentified in earlier years were provided by Teresa Nettleton, and the appropriate changes were made on that date as well.[MAH 8 December 1997] It was determined that for the 1997 data, all Cladonia pocillum occurances had been given an incorrect numeric code of 289 instead of the correct code of 298. The 1997 data were reprocessed, and replaced in the data section of this file on 14 January 1998. Corrections for the conditions of several plants from 1995 and 1997 were provided by Teresa Nettleton, and the appropriate changes were made on that date as well.[MAH 14 January 1998] Corrections for several height measurements on the 1997 hard copy data sheets were provided by Teresa Nettleton. The appropriate changes were made, and the data were reprocessed and replaced in the data section of this file on 24 March 1998.[MAH 24 March 1998] Miscellaneous comments and additional present species from 1997 were appended to the comments section on 15 August 2000.[MAH 15 August 2000]. Missing data for 1989, plots 2-19 were inserted into the data section.[TMA 17 April 2006] Data for plot 10A for 1989 were inserted into the data section.[TMA 11 September 2007]. Data were reformatted to remove heights and condition classes, middle heights for 1989 were incorporated, and species numbers were converted to USDA PLANTS codes with associated names. All lichen and moss hits were converted to generic “2MOSS” and “2LICHN” designations for consistency with post-1997 data. Data for 2006 to 2014 were added. Column data were edited to reflect the new format.[HCH 30 December] Data for 2015 and 2016 were appended. New columns for LTER and local site names were added.[HCH 11 January 2018]Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[SCE 2018-10-08] Data for 2017 and part of 2018 were appended, a few lines corrections
were made to 2018 data, format updated to provide x,y coordinates instead of
numeric points, write out file as quoted csv, added extended methods[SCE 21 May 2019]  Data for 2017 were replaced with newly qa/qc data; all middle hits changed to 'middle1' or 'middle2' for consistency across time; duplicate hits in same plot identified and corrected, and part of 2018 were appended, a few lines corrections made to litter incorrectly entered as lichen and SAPL2 incorrectly identified as SAGL; authorship reverted to Marilyn Walker as lead author who designed the sampling.

          The data in this file through 1997 were manually entered from field data sheets by data management personnel using an EasyEntry form. Subsequently, data were entered into Excel spreadsheets formatted to replicate plot sheets. Point records were converted to plant cover using macros. The resulting files were processed and/or archived on the NWT LTER server.
          In 2006 and thereafter, species and nonspecies codes were recorded using USDA PLANTS codes. Codes used in earlier years were converted to these codes. Codes that begin with “2” are nonspecies.
          Also, lichens and mosses were not identified to species in these years.
          All species identifications after 2011 should be considered PRELIMINARY, especially for Carex species. These and earlier data are subject to revision.
          Ancillary information about data recorded from 1989 to 1997:
          
          In 1990 - 1997, only top and bottom hits were recorded.
          Species condition codes and canopy heights were recorded for all species
          for these years, but not thereafter. Species condition and height data 
          are available from the NWT LTER data manager.
          Distances from the frame to a top canopy plant hit and to a surface
          layer plant hit were measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and recorded. 
          Plant genus and species were also recorded at both hits at each point. 
          Species condition codes are 1 (live), 2 (standing dead), 3 (dead),
          and 5 (other). Species condition code 5 was used for all non-vegetation 
          hits (e.g., soil, litter, rock, bare). Hit codes are 1 ("bullseye" hit) 
          and 0 (mediocre hit). Woody (1) or non-woody (0) conditions were also 
          recorded for each species. 
          The sampling methodology differed slightly in 1989 from sampling in 1990-1997.
          In particular, neither canopy heights nor woodiness conditions were recorded. A
          third "middle" layer was also often recorded in 1989, and are
          listed as point ID, plot number, numeric species code, hit quality,
          and species condition:

          Notes and comments for individual plots for the 1990 measurements:
          101,A and B reg. tics moved a few mm to NE
          17,moved NW marker
          18,moved SW marker
          201,no measurements of leg height
          21,moved SE corner
          27,moved reg marker at leg A
          30,moved SW marker
          31,SE marker moved
          37,SE corner was clamped to rebar
          39,NE marker moved
          40,NW marker moved
          47,"A" corner (1990)="B" corner (1989)=south corner.Plot orientation is
          	weird, last yearâ€™s data will be off. {corrected data for 1989 for plot 
          	47 were provided by Leanne Leastak prior to inclusion in this file}
          50,SW marker moved
          55,eastern markers "pretty bad" but none were moved
          63,NE marker very far off
          65,SE marker is 1"" S of where it should be
          66,moved SW marker-SW leg hole was replaced
          69,moved SW reg marker
          72,NW marker was removed during the winter and found apx. 30cm E.It was replaced.
          75,SW and SE support pole holes are 1" E of the poles.The poles would not stay on the point.
          76,NW corner leg .5" off
          801,moved NE marker
          Ancillary metadata for the 1995 data for each plot are plot number,

          Plot 37 was the only plot measured in 1996. It was measured on
          9 August 1996 by PLT. The height from the ground surface to
          the bottom of the point quadrat frame at the southwest, southeast,
          northwest, and northeast corners were 6.2 cm, 9.8 cm, 7.5 cm and
          8.1 cm respectively.
          Ancillary metadata for the 1997 data for each plot are plot number,
          survey date (mm/dd/yyyy), initials of field person #1 (999 if unknown),
          initials of field person #2 (999 if unknown), height from ground surface
          to bottom of point quadrat frame at southwest corner (cm), height from
          ground surface to bottom of point quadrat frame at southeast corner (cm),
          height from ground surface to bottom of point quadrat frame at northwest
          corner (cm), and height from ground surface to bottom of point quadrat

          Tim Bardsley and Mike Hartman conducted a rudimentary survey of some of
          the more heavily used NWT LTER research plots in 1994 in order to
          reference the plots to established objects/points on Niwot Ridge.
          A Silva Ranger compass was used with E declination set at 12 degrees;
          the accuracy of the bearings is +/- 3 degrees. All distances were
          measured across the ground surface (not at a fixed horizontal level);
          such distances are accurate to +/- 2%. The Saddle grid species 
          composition plots were 1x1 m and the corners were marked by aluminum 
          tags nailed to the ground. An iron rebar post was placed outside of 
          each of these corners and the following bearings and distances are from 
          the corresponding Saddle grid stake to the northwesterly of these posts 
          for each plot. In some cases then, depending on the location of the 
          plot relative to the Saddle grid stake, the distance measured is not to 
          the nearest rebar for a given plot. For plots surveyed on 6 July 1994, 
          the grid stake number, bearing from the grid stake to the northwest 
          corner rebar post (in degrees), and the distance from the grid stake to 
          the northwest corner rebar post (in meters) are:
