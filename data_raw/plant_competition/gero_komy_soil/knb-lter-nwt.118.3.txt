    This study was initiated to examine bulk density and organic matter content differences between soils where Geum (Acomastylis) rossii and Kobresia myosuroides were present. A subset of samples were also measured for total C, N, and P. Paired plots were randomly selected in locations where Kobresia and Geum populations were adjacent to one another. Soil samples were collected from 35 plots, 22 and 13 of which had southerly and northerly aspects, respectively. Soil cores were removed with 3.5-cm interior diameter PVC pipe that was driven into the tundra by use of a rubber mallet. The minimum depth of individual cores was 9 cm, and these depths were recorded at the time of removal (15 July, 19 July, 22 July, and 9 August 1993).

        Study areas were located on Niwot Ridge and around gopher-disturbed areas on a south-facing slope located about 100-150 m northeast of TVan and a north-facing slope located on the west side of the Saddle. Consult Tim Seastedt for location of original data.

      The initial iteration of the documentation section of this file was generated by Roberto Cortinas and Rick Ingersoll in early June of 1994. The data for 1993 were added to the data section and the file was put under sccs control on 3 June 1994.[RCI 3 June 1994] Comments were provided by Tim Seastedt and incorporated into the documentation section on 22 June 1994.[RCI 22 June 1994] Total C, N, and P data were inserted into the data section and appropriate comments were inserted into the abstract and comments section on 3 January 1997.[MAH 3 January 1997] Edited title and keywords for inclusion in core organic matter dynamics data sets.[HCH 30 April 2010] The title, keywords, and units were edited, labels shortened, and definitions added.[HCH 13 May 2016] Units for density were updated to be gramsperCubicCentimeter as inferred from similar datasets, changed from grampercentimeter [ATW 28 Oct. 2019].

          The organic matter data were manually entered from laboratory data sheets using an EasyEntry form. The soil physical property data were provided on floppy diskette by Roberto Cortinas and had been saved as an ASCII file from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet. The latter data were joined with the former during processing on niwotlter (NWT LTER server). The CHN and total phosphorus analysis were performed by the Stable Isotope/Soil Biology Laboratory of the University of Georgia Institute of Ecology. Detailed information concerning the methods used in the Dumas combustion assays performed to determine total N and total C, as well as the persulfate digestions and colorimetric assays performed to determine total phosphorus are available from the Laboratory via the World Wide Web at http://ash.ecology.uga.edu/. The total N, total C, C/N ratio, and total P data were provided by Tim Seastedt in a 24 December 1996 email message. An ASCII version of the original message has been archived as /data1/Datman/Tims/Som/Archive/email.cnp. A copy of the message was reformatted using various Unix commands, and the data were joined with the data in this file. Empty columns were added to the records for samples which were not sent for further analysis in order to maintain a consistent format.
          Cores were collected and placed in labelled paper bags. After air drying, cores were poured through #10 soil sieve. Large rocks and organic material (>1 cm) were removed and placed in a separate dish. Cores were homogenized using a wooden pestle in a mortar. The resulting homogenate was passed through #10 sieve with a gloved (vinyl) hand. After sieving, the soil was air dried again.
          In the laboratory, soil samples were dried at 105 degrees Celsius for at least 24 hours. The samples were then sieved through a 2-mm mesh screen. Rocks were separated from the sample and weighed. The sieved soils were also weighed. Soil bulk density was calculated as (sieved dry soil weight/core volume), whereas total bulk density was calculated as (sieved dry soil + rock weight/core volume). New crucibles were ashed to ensure removal of organics. Otherwise they were cleaned with soap and water, followed by a distilled water rinse. Approximately 2 g of air dried soil was placed into a previously weighed crucible and the crucible + sample weight was recorded. The crucible and soil sample were oven dried at 105 degrees Celsius until constant weight was reached. This weight was recorded. After pre-charring, samples were muffled for 2 hr at 550 degrees Celsius and reweighed after allowing rehydration at 105 degrees Celsius.
          Plots were located near the gopher-disturbed sites utilized for the litter decomposition studies (/data1/Datman/Nwtdata/litdecom.rc).
          The carbon fraction can be estimated by multiplying the organic matter fraction by 0.44.
