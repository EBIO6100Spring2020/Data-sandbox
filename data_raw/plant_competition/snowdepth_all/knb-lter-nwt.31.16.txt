      The depth of snow was measured at 88 points on the saddle grid. The 500 x 350 m study area (17.5 ha) consisted of a grid of 8 rows of stakes in an east/west direction and 11 rows of stakes in a north/south direction (for a total of 88 stakes). The stakes were located 50 m apart. Each stake was given a point identification number starting with 1 in the southwest corner and progressing in an easterly direction for each of the east/west rows so that if head of this file represented the north compass point and the tail represented the south compass point, then the grid would look like this:
      71   72   73   74   75   76   77   78   79   80   801(=80A)
      61   62   63   64   65   66   67   68   69   70   701(=70A)
      51   52   53   54   55   56   57   58   59   60   601(=60A)
      41   42   43   44   45   46   47   48   49   50   501(=50A)
      31   32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   40   401(=40A)
      21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   301(=30A)
      11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   201(=20A)
      1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   101(=10A)
      Note that stakes along the east boundary of the grid, i.e. those ending with the "A", were given new designations to facilitate incorporation of the data into the Saddle GIS. Snow depths at each of the stakes were recorded on a weekly to biweekly basis throughout the period during which snow accumulation existed on the Saddle.

      The documentation for this file was created by Susan Kindig in May of 1993, with additional information being supplied by Rick Ingersoll and Brad Lewis. Data for 30 October 1992 to 29 May 1993 were added to the data section and the file was placed under sccs control during early June 1993.[RCI 4 June 1993] All data beginning 30 October 1992 were double- entered using EasyEntry programs (see "The Management of NWT LTER Data on the PC") and then processed on a Sun SPARC 2 (see "The Management of NWT LTER Data on culter").[RCI 14 June 1993] Data for 22 June 1993 were appended to the data section on 29 June 1993.[RCI 29 June 1993] Data for 1 and 19 July were appended to the data section on 23 July 1993.[RCI 23 July 1993] Data for 2 November 1993 were appended on 4 November 1993.[RCI 4 November 1993] Data for 20 November 1993 were appended on 23 November 1993.[RCI 23 November 1993] Data for 11 December 1993 were appended on 14 December 1993.[RCI 14 December 1993] Data for 30 December 1993 were appended to the data section on 7 January 1994.

[RCI 8 February 1994] Data for 26 February and 17 March 1994 were appended to the data section on 5 April 1994.[RCI 5 April 1994] Data for 18 April 1994 were appended to the data section on 29 April 1994. [RCI 29 April 1994] Data for 9 April 1994 were inserted into the data section on 18 May 1994.[RCI 18 May 1994] Data for 2 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 7 June 1994.[RCI 7 June 1994] On 29 June 1994, Brad Lewis determined that the snow depth values recorded for grid stakes 48, 58, and 68 were erroneous for both 26 February and 17 March 1994. The snow depth values for those stakes for those days were changed to missing value indicators (999) in this file only (not in any EasyEntry or other processed data files) on 29 June 1994.[RCI 29 June 1994] Data for 14 May 1994 were inserted into the data section on 1 September 1994.[RCI 1 September 1994] Data for 9 January 1995 were appended to the data section on 20 January 1995.[RCI 20 January 1995] Missing value indicators for snow depth were changed from "999" to absence of value in order to conserve space on 20 January 1995.[RCI 20 January 1995] Data for 19 May 1995 were appended to the data section on 23 May 1995.[RCI 23 May 1995] Data for 1 June 1995 were appended to the data section on 6 June 1995.[RCI 6 June 1995] Data for 5 June 1995 were appended to the data section on 7 June 1995.[RCI 7 June 1995] Data for 12 June 1995 were appended to the data section on 15 June 1995.[RCI 15 June 1995] Data for 19 and 26 June 1995 were appended to the data section on 7 July 1995.[RCI 7 July 1995] Data for 7 and 13 July 1995 were appended to the data section on 19 July 1995.[RCI 19 July 1995] Data for 24 July 1995 and 2 August 1995 were appended to the data section on 8 August 1995.[MAH 8 August 1995] Data for 11 January 1996 were appended to the data section on 23 January 1996.[MAH 23 January 1996] Data for 28 February 1996 were appended to the data section on 13 March 1996.[MAH 13 March 1996] Data for 13 March 1996 were appended to the data section on 20 March 1996.[MAH 20 March 1996] Data for 27 March 1996 were appended to the data section on 9 April 1996.[MAH 9 April 1996] Data for 9 and 22 May 1996 were appended to the data section on 29 May 1996.[MAH 29 May 1996] Data for 7 and 14 June 1996 were appended to the data section on 2 July 1996.[MAH 2 July 1996] Data for 3 and 10 July 1996 were appended to the data section on 22 July 1996.[MAH 22 July 1996] Data for 26 June 1996 were inserted into the data section, and data for 16, 24, and 30 July 1996 and 6 August 1996 were appended to the data section on 18 October 1996.[MAH 18 October 1996] Data for 21 November 1996 were appended to the data section on 16 December 1996.[MAH 16 December 1996] Data for 28 January 1996 and 28 January 1997 were inserted and appended, respectively, to the data section on 13 February 1997.[MAH 13 February] Data for 13 February 1997 were appended to the data section on 24 February 1997.[MAH 24 February 1997] Data for 7 March 1997 were appended to the data section on 26 March 1997.[MAH 26 March 1997] Data for 15 May 1997 were appended to the data section on 26 June 1997.[MAH 26 June 1997] Data for 21 March, 9, 19, and 26 June, 10 July, 1 August, 28 November, and 18 December 1997, and 9 January 1998 were inserted in the data section on 17 February 1998.[MAH 17 February 1998] Data for 24 March 1998 were appended to the data section on 7 April 1998.[MAH 7 April 1998] Data for 18 and 27 May 1998 were appended to the data section on 17 June 1998.[MAH 17 June 1998] Data for 26 June 1998 were appended to the data section on 6 October 1998.[MAH 6 October 1998] On 25 February 1999, it was determined that the 09 June 1997 survey had been measured in decimeters.

        The Saddle grid snow survey was initiated in 1982 by Jim Halfpenny; Skip Walker assumed responsibility for the continuation of this survey in the autumn of 1992. Prior to that time, depths were measured at a location (in the vicinity of a grid stake in an area characterized by a great deal of snow depth variability) deemed to be representative of a "mean" snow depth for that particular grid stake. These earlier data can be found in
From 30 October 1992 until 31 January 1993, 1 to 5 measurements were made in the vicinity of stakes in areas characterized by a great deal of snow depth variability, means of such measurements were calculated, and it was those means that were manually entered into the computer. The EasyEntry program for manual entry of the snow survey data, as well as the Unix programs for post-EasyEntry processing, were modified for all data collected after 1 February 1993 in order to allow for entry of 5 separate snow-depth measurements associated with each of the grid stakes, i.e. at the grid stake as well as 1 to 2 m in each of the four cardinal directions from the grid stake. The files produced by these programs contain the means in addition to the "raw" measure- ments used to derive those means. For the sake of consistency, columns containing missing value indicators were inserted in the appropriate positions of the pre-February 1993 data prior to their incorporation in this file. It should be noted, however, that a single measurement at a particular stake prior to February 1993 may, in fact, be either the result of "mental" averaging in the field or be a true calculated mean of more than a single measurement. Also note that data prior to autumn 1992 were not available for the initial iteration of this file. The initial column in the data section contains a sort number used to faciliate data processing prior to incorporation into ARC/INFO format. The hard copy data sheet for the 21 March 1997 survey contained the note "?200" for grid stake 65, and ">370" for grid stake 55. Both were entered as missing values.
