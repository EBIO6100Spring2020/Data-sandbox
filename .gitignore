# This is the main .gitignore file
# There are others in the data directories.
# For large datasets, use .gitignore in the data_raw or data_derived 
# directories as necessary.

# This .gitignore is to share with everyone and should contain only rules that 
# are relevant to everyone. To exclude additional files only on your local 
# machine, use the "Explicit repository excludes" mechanism:
